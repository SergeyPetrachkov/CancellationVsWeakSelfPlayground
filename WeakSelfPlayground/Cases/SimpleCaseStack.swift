 * MEMORY MANAGEMENT PATTERNS FOR SINGLE ASYNC TASKS
 * 
 * This file demonstrates four different cases related to handling memory management
 * in async Swift code with single unstructured Task operations. Each pattern shows different
 * trade-offs between safety, complexity, and performance.
 * 
 * The progression from NoWeakInteractor ‚Üí WeakInteractor ‚Üí GuardLetInteractor shows
 * how different capture strategies affect object lifetime and memory management.
 *
 * EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE:
 * - Compare no capture vs weak self vs task cancellation patterns
 * - See how guard-let affects weak capture and extends object lifetime
 * - Understand memory management scenarios in async/await code
 * - Learn proper cleanup strategies for long-running operations
 *
 * TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 1. Run the app and tap "SingleTask" tab
 * 2. Try each pattern button and immediately dismiss the sheet
 * 3. Observe console output for deinit messages
 * 4. Missing deinit = memory leak detected
 * 5. Pay attention to time stamps to see how long objects stay in memory
 *
 * PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED:
 * 
 * 1. NoWeakInteractor - MEMORY LEAK PATTERN (Educational)
 *    ‚ùå Task holds strong reference to self, preventing deallocation while the Task is running
 *    üìù Demonstrates the baseline problem of resources staying in memory longer than needed
 *
 * 2. WeakInteractor - WEAK REFERENCE PATTERN
 *    ‚úÖ Uses [weak self] capture list - deallocates entities within VIP stack immediatelly
 *    ‚úÖ Allows interactor to be deallocated while task continues
 *    ‚úÖ Task continues but operations on nil self are safely ignored
 *    üìù Good for fire-and-forget operations where results aren't critical
 *
 * 3. CancellationInteractor - RECOMMENDED PATTERN
 *    ‚úÖ Stores Task reference for explicit cancellation
 *    ‚úÖ Immediately terminates async work on view dismissal
 *    ‚úÖ Resource efficient: no wasted computation (if cancellation is handled correctly downstream)
 *    ‚úÖ Clear semantics: operation explicitly cancelled vs silently ignored
 *    ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly more complex (requires task storage)
 *    üìù Best for operations where early termination is desirable
 *
 * 4. GuardLetInteractor - EXTENDED LIFETIME PATTERN (Educational)
 *    ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses [weak self] + guard let self - creates temporary strong reference
 *    ‚ö†Ô∏è Prevents deallocation during entire async operation
 *    ‚ö†Ô∏è Objects stay in memory longer than necessary
 *    üìù Shows why guard let self can be problematic in long-running async contexts
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - Async operations can outlive the views that created them
 * - [weak self] prevents memory leaks but allows silent result discarding
 * - guard let self creates strong references that prevent cleanup until Task finishes
 * - Task cancellation provides immediate termination and resource efficiency
 * - Choose cancellation for user-initiated operations, weak self for background/fire-and-forget work
 * - Pay attention to timestamps in console output to understand object lifetimes
 * - Always monitor console output for deinit messages during development
 *
 * MEMORY LIFETIME PROGRESSION:
 * NoWeakInteractor:     Object lives until Task completes (7+ seconds)
 * WeakInteractor:       Object can die immediately when view dismissed
 * CancellationInteractor: Object dies immediately + Task terminates
 * GuardLetInteractor:   Object lives until Task completes (like NoWeak but with [weak self])
