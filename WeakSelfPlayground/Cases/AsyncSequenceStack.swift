 *
 * MEMORY MANAGEMENT PATTERNS FOR ASYNC SEQUENCES
 * 
 * This file demonstrates four different approaches to handling memory management
 * in async Swift code with infinite AsyncSequence operations. Unlike single tasks,
 * async sequences can run indefinitely, making proper memory management critical
 * to prevent both memory leaks and resource waste.
 * 
 * The progression shows how different capture strategies affect object lifetime
 * when dealing with potentially infinite streams of data.
 *
 * EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE:
 * - Compare memory management patterns in long-running async sequences
 * - Understand how infinite loops affect object lifecycle
 * - See the differences between single tasks vs continuous sequences
 * - Learn when task cancellation becomes essential vs optional
 *
 * TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 1. Run the app and tap "AsyncSequence" tab
 * 2. Try each pattern button and immediately dismiss the sheet
 * 3. Observe console output for deinit messages
 * 4. Missing deinit = memory leak detected
 * 5. Pay attention to timestamps - sequences may run indefinitely
 * 6. To trigger notifications: switch to another app and back to see immediate results
 * 7. Each app switch will generate "Received notification" logs - watch for patterns
 *
 * PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED:
 * 
 * 1. InfiniteSequenceInteractor - MEMORY LEAK PATTERN (Educational)
 *    ‚ùå No capture list - self is retained by a strong reference
 *    ‚ùå Infinite loop prevents deallocation indefinitely
 *    ‚ùå Objects stay in memory until app termination
 *    üìù Demonstrates why async sequences are more dangerous than single tasks
 *    üß™ Test: Switch apps - you'll see "Received notification" logs even after dismissing sheet
 *
 * 2. WeakSequenceInteractor - WEAK REFERENCE PATTERN
 *    ‚úÖ Uses [weak self] capture list - allows immediate deallocation
 *    ‚úÖ Sequence continues but operations on nil self are safely ignored
 *    ‚ùå Sequence loop continues running even after objects are deallocated
 *    üìù Ok for non-critical background monitoring if resource waste is acceptable
 *    üß™ Test: Switch apps - you'll see "Received notification" logs but no UI updates
 *
 * 3. CancelSequenceInteractor - RECOMMENDED PATTERN
 *    ‚úÖ Stores Task reference for explicit cancellation
 *    ‚úÖ Immediately terminates infinite sequence on view dismissal
 *    ‚úÖ Resource efficient: stops unnecessary async work completely
 *    ‚úÖ Clear semantics: sequence explicitly stopped vs silently ignored
 *    üìù Best practice for async sequences - always store and cancel tasks
 *    üß™ Test: Switch apps - no "Received notification" logs after dismissing sheet
 *
 * 4. GuardLetSequenceInteractor - EXTENDED LIFETIME PATTERN (Educational)
 *    ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses [weak self] + guard let self - creates temporary strong reference
 *    ‚ö†Ô∏è Prevents deallocation during the entire sequence duration
 *    ‚ùå Effectively same as InfiniteSequenceInteractor for infinite sequences
 *    üìù Shows why guard let self is particularly dangerous with async sequences
 *    üß™ Test: Switch apps - you'll see "Received notification" logs even after dismissing sheet
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - Async sequences are more dangerous than single tasks for memory management
 * - Infinite sequences without cancellation = guaranteed memory leaks
 * - [weak self] allows deallocation but doesn't stop the sequence loop
 * - guard let self + infinite sequence = permanent memory retention
 * - Task cancellation is essential (not optional) for async sequences
 * - NotificationCenter.publisher creates potentially infinite streams
 * - Always store and cancel Task references for async sequence operations
 * - UIApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification fires on every app switch - perfect for testing
 * - Console logs show "Received notification" for each event - easy to verify behavior
 *
 * MEMORY LIFETIME COMPARISON:
 * InfiniteSequenceInteractor:    Object lives until app termination
 * WeakSequenceInteractor:        Object can die immediately, sequence continues
 * CancelSequenceInteractor:      Object dies immediately + sequence terminates
 * GuardLetSequenceInteractor:    Object lives until app termination (like Infinite)
 *
 * ASYNC SEQUENCE vs SINGLE TASK:
 * - Single tasks eventually complete, sequences may never complete
 * - Weak self is "acceptable" for tasks, "problematic" for sequences
 * - Cancellation is "nice to have" for tasks, "essential" for sequences
 * - Guard let is "dangerous" for tasks, "catastrophic" for sequences
